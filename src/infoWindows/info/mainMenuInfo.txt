This program was made to make it easier to understand what algorithms do when they run.
Click any algorithm on the main screen and it will take you to a new window where you can try the algorithm out.
If at any point you are in doubt about how to start the algorithm or what it does
you can always refer to the "?" -button and it will display info about the algorithm and how to start it.

Please note as this program was made for visualization it is not optimised for huge inputs
and therefore it might take a long time to calculate before showing the visuals if huge inputs are given.
What a "huge input" is might vary from computer to computer but if you stay <1000 elements at all times it should not take long.



This program was created and developed by Kenny Brink.
