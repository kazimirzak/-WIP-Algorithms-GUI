Linear search sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds an element that matches the target value. If the algorithm reaches the end of the list, the search terminates unsuccessfully.

The running times for linear search are:
Worst-case: O(n)
Best-case: O(1)
Average-case: O(n)

Please note that the array does not have to be sorted for this algorithm to work.
For all numbers mentioned below the following requirements should be met:
It has to be a whole number and if it negative it should be write as "-x" so negative 10 becomes "-10".
