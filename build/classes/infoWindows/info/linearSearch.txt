Linear search is a searching algorithm that starts at index 0 of an array
and checks whether the given number is equal to the number in that index.
It then increments the index by 1 and checks again.
This algorithm stops once the number is found or the whole array has been searched.

The running times for linear search are:
Worst-case: O(n)
Best-case: O(1)
Average-case: O(n)

Please note that the array does not have to be sorted for this algorithm to work.
