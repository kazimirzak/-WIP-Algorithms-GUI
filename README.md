GUI for visualizting various algorithms.
This was devolped while I was taking a algorithms and datastructures course for my CS major.
It uses JavaFX to show all the visuals. There are a few bugs in the code at the moment. I was in a hurry to get it done before the exam in the course. That in turn also means this is a WIP, however I will probably never return to this project so USE AT OWN RISK!

You simply just run the mainMenu.java and everything should work. When the program is running there is always a "?" in the top toolbar, if that is clicked there will be an explanation of each window and how to use it.

(This is not my proudest creation!)
