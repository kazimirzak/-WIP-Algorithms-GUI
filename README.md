GUI for visualizting various algorithms.
This was devolped while I was taking a algorithms and datastructures course for my CS major.
It uses JavaFX to show all the visuals. There are a few bugs in the code at the moment. I was in a hurry to get it done before the exam in the course. If anyone would like to see an updated version of this please let me know.

You simply just run the mainMenu.java and everything should work. When the program is running there is always a "?" in the top toolbar, if that is clicked there will be an explanation of each window and how to use it.

(This is not my proudest creation!)
